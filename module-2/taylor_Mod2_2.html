        <h2>Chapter 1: The Beginning</h2>
        <p class = "intro">My name is Juan Taylor. I am a student studying Software Engineering at Bellevue University. I hope to achieve my Bachelor's Degree within the next year. After that I intend to continue to purse my education and gt a Master's Degree.</p>
        <p>I enjoy a multitude of hobbies that keep me active such as hiking, rock climbing, traveling,and canoeing. Whenever I travel I normally make sure to visit one of the nature parks to enjoy the scenery. Canoeing is a leisurely experience of exercise I appreciate a lot. Walking around and trying foods from different cultures is also fun.</p>
        <p>Other hobbies I like are playing video games, watching movies, and reading. First person shooters, fighting games, and RPGs are the genre of games I normally play. It's hard for me to pinpoint a favorite game or movie. I enjoy so many. <span class ="sentence">My favorite book series of all time is the Dark Tower.</span></p>
        <p>Over the next few weeks I hope to learn a lot about building web pages. I regularly code and hope to build my knowledge in various programming languages. My goal is to become a well-round Fullstack engineer. I want to learn more about the cloud as well.</p>
